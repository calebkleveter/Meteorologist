A simple weather app that uses a few APIs and libraries such as:

- [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/)
- CoreLocation
- MapKit
- Auto Layout

It also uses:

- A UI programed in Swift
- Delegation
- [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)
- [IonIcons](http://ionicons.com/)
- No third party libraries

## Development:

If you want to run this app you will need:

- Xcode 9 with Swift 4
- A Dark Sky account

Create a file called `Secure.swift` and add a constant called `API_KEY` with your API key.

## Questions You Might Have:

Q: Is this app on the App Store?

A: No, it is not. The reason for this is because I didn't add anything special to this app to make it different from the ones already on the App Store. This would just be another app buried among the others that have already been submitted and make it harder for people to find what they want.
