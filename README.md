# Meteorologist

A simple weather app that uses a few APIs and libraries such as:

- [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/)

- MapKit
- Auto Layout

It also uses:

- A UI programed in Swift
- Delegation
- [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)
- [IonIcons](http://ionicons.com/)
- No third party libraries

## Development:

If you want to run this app you will need:

- A Dark Sky account

Create a file called `Secure.swift` and add a constant called `API_KEY` with your API key.
